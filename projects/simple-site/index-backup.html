        <h1>It works.</h1>
        <p>This is a very basic landing page to prove the website is being served correctly.</p>

        <h2>How this site was built & deployed (100% mobile from an iPhone)</h2>
        <p>
          This site is intentionally simple, but the deployment is real: it’s containerized and shipped to AWS ECS
          Fargate behind an ALB with TLS, with CI/CD wired up so changes can automatically roll out from Git.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every step of the process was done on an iPhone. Cursor agent instructions, GitHub interactions, and AWS
          operations were all executed mobile-first to prove the entire workflow can be done without a laptop.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Start small:</strong> a single static <code>index.html</code> in <code>projects/simple-site/</code>.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Containerize:</strong> an NGINX <code>Dockerfile</code> serves the static HTML on port 80.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Infrastructure:</strong> a CloudFormation template provisions VPC networking, an internet-facing ALB,
            an ACM certificate validated via Route 53, and an ECS Fargate service pulling from ECR.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automated delivery:</strong> a CodePipeline + CodeBuild flow (via an existing CodeStar/CodeConnections
            connection) builds the image and deploys it to the running service when the repo updates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Git sync:</strong> a <code>ci/deployment.yaml</code> is included to make CloudFormation GitSync
            deployments straightforward.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Mobile-only workflow highlights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cursor agents on iPhone:</strong> all prompt iterations, code generation, and review flowed through a
            mobile session.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>GitHub fully mobile:</strong> the initial repo was created on GitHub from the phone, with subsequent
            commits, reviews, and merges also handled on mobile.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AWS fully mobile:</strong> parameter ARNs were gathered (Route 53 zone, ACM cert, CodeConnections),
            the CloudFormation stack was deployed, and ECS services + CloudFormation events + pipeline runs were
            monitored from the iPhone.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The overall effort was a short set of iterations: specify the outcome, generate an initial version, review it,
          remove unnecessary knobs, and then lock in the final domain + connection details.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key part of making an agent effective is human product intuition. Matthew Davies guided the agent with clear
          constraints, practical AWS context (Route 53 zone + connection ARN), and quick reviews that kept the solution
          focused and deployable without overengineering.
