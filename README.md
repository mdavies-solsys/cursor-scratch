## cursor-scratch

This repo is a **low-stakes sandbox** for experimenting with Cursor agents, prompts, and small code spikes.

### How to use

- If you want to try something quickly, put it under `playground/`.
- If you have a reusable result you might copy elsewhere, put it under `snippets/` (small, portable, documented).
- If you’re just capturing thoughts, put it under `notes/`.

### For future Cursor agents

Start by reading `AGENTS.md` — it explains the repo’s purpose, structure, and conventions to keep experiments organized.
